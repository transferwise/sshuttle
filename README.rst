tshuttle: where transparent proxy meets VPN meets ssh
=====================================================

tshuttle is the only program that solves the following
common case:

- Your client machine (or router) is Linux, FreeBSD, or MacOS.

- You have access to a remote network via teleport.

- You don't want to create an ssh port forward for every
  single host/port on the remote network.

**Note that this is a fork of sshuttle to enable it to work with teleport. we are renaming it to tshuttle.
The real repo is here: https://github.com/sshuttle/sshuttle**
